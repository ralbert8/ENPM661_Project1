# 🏫 ENPM661: Project 1 | Riley Albert

This project demonstrates the use of the Breadth-First Search Algorithm to solve an 8-piece sliding puzzle.

---

## 🗂️ Required Libraries:
- `copy`: Copying states to update new states.
- `random`: Randomizing start states
- `os`: File Operations
- `collections`: Queueing for BFS

---

## ▶ Running the Code:
- Run the 'proj1_riley_albert.py' script. This will save the .txt files in the current working directory.
- Place 'Animate.py' in the same working directory as the .py and .txt files. This only reads the specific file names, so they need to be kept together.
- Run 'Animate.py'. This will read the .txt files in its directory and animate the puzzle solution.
