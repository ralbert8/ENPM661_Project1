ENPM661: Project 1 | Riley Albert

Required Libraries:
- Copy: Copying states to update new states.
- Random: Randomizing start states
- OS: File Operations
- Collections: Queueing for BFS

Running the Code:
- Run the 'proj1_riley_albert.py' script. This will save the .txt files in the current working directory.
- Place 'Animate.py' in the same working directory as the .py and .txt files. This only reads the specific file names, so they need to be kept together.
- Run 'Animate.py'. This will read the .txt files in its directory and animate the puzzle solution.

Relevant Notes:
- The initial .txt files provided with the submission will not necessarily be the same solution provided when running the script again.
  The start states are randomized, so there will be a different start and solution process for every execution.
